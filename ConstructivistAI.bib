	abstract = {The fields of Origin of Life and Artificial Life both question what life is and how it emerges from a distinct set of "pre-life" dynamics. One common feature of most substrates where life emerges is a marked shift in dynamics when self-replication appears. While there are some hypotheses regarding how self-replicators arose in nature, we know very little about the general dynamics, computational principles, and necessary conditions for self-replicators to emerge. This is especially true on "computational substrates" where interactions involve logical, mathematical, or programming rules. In this paper we take a step towards understanding how self-replicators arise by studying several computational substrates based on various simple programming languages and machine instruction sets. We show that when random, non self-replicating programs are placed in an environment lacking any explicit fitness landscape, self-replicators tend to arise. We demonstrate how this occurs due to random interactions and self-modification, and can happen with and without background random mutations. We also show how increasingly complex dynamics continue to emerge following the rise of self-replicators. Finally, we show a counterexample of a minimalistic programming language where self-replicators are possible, but so far have not been observed to arise.},

In parallel, symbolic learning systems have shown success at certain types of abstract reasoning, as demonstrated in the Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge by Kaggle. Yet, these symbolic learners are challenged when generalizing to data from the analog world. This paper will present and evaluate ideas for using symbolic learning concepts to guide learning of a neural network in a constructivist way. We aim to show how a neural network with internal feedback can be used - somewhat like the brain - to suggest the proper actions to take and predict the results of those actions. In other words, the system will create an internal model of the world on which it can reason. The neurosymbolic system we consider is inspired by the symbolic learning system from Gary Dresher and neural network cortical columns as discussed by Jeff Hawkins. The hybrid system aims to create a synthesis which can generalize on real-world concepts while also quickly learning from few examples as the world changes and prior experience is found to be inaccurate.},
