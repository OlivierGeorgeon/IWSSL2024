	abstract = {The fields of Origin of Life and Artificial Life both question what life is and how it emerges from a distinct set of "pre-life" dynamics. One common feature of most substrates where life emerges is a marked shift in dynamics when self-replication appears. While there are some hypotheses regarding how self-replicators arose in nature, we know very little about the general dynamics, computational principles, and necessary conditions for self-replicators to emerge. This is especially true on "computational substrates" where interactions involve logical, mathematical, or programming rules. In this paper we take a step towards understanding how self-replicators arise by studying several computational substrates based on various simple programming languages and machine instruction sets. We show that when random, non self-replicating programs are placed in an environment lacking any explicit fitness landscape, self-replicators tend to arise. We demonstrate how this occurs due to random interactions and self-modification, and can happen with and without background random mutations. We also show how increasingly complex dynamics continue to emerge following the rise of self-replicators. Finally, we show a counterexample of a minimalistic programming language where self-replicators are possible, but so far have not been observed to arise.},

Two ways of bringing the two approaches together are suggested: elaborating the parallels between them (such as the concept of schemata), and building {AI} models based directly on Piaget's theory. How this might benefit {AI} is illustrated by examining how Piagetian research on problem solving can suggest new ways of building programs that learn.},

Miola's edited work also features a comprehensive critical history, coupled with a full bibliography and photographs of major productions of the play from around the world. In the collection, there are five previously unpublished essays. The topics covered in these new essays are women in the play, the play's debt to contemporary theater, its critical and performance histories in Germany and Japan, the metrical variety of the play, and the distinctly modern perspective on the play as containing dark and disturbing elements. To compliment these new essays, the collection features significant scholarship and commentary on The Comedy of Errors that is published in obscure and difficulty accessible journals, newspapers, and other sources. This collection brings together these essays for the first time.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In the enactivist framework, habits are precarious, self-sustaining, and self-individuating sensorimotor structures: they are a first approximation of autonomous sensorimotor entities. We present a prototype computational model which demonstrates a relatively simple mechanism for facilitating the emergence of such habits in robots. At its core this model is a system which retains a history of sensorimotor sequences which are compared and re-enacted by the controller as a function of the recent sensorimotor activity of the controlled robot. To demonstrate an application of this model concretely, we also present a minimal cognition task loosely inspired by the role of sensorimotor contingencies in human colour perception. This task requires that a robot maintains a set of particular sensorimotor coordinations which allow it to respond to different objects appropriately, influenced by an evolved behavioural history.},
